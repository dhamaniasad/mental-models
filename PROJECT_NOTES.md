# Mental Models Project Notes

## Project Vision
To create a visually distinctive, interactive, and educational experience showcasing mental models through innovative design and thoughtful interactions.

## Key Goals
1. **Create a Visually Distinctive Experience** 
   - Stand out from typical landing pages
   - Design something AWWWARD-worthy
   - Elevate the visualization of abstract concepts

2. **Prioritize Experiential Learning**
   - Make mental models intuitive through interaction
   - Create "aha" moments through design
   - Enable embodied understanding, not just reading

3. **Balance Artistry and Usability**
   - Push creative boundaries while maintaining usability
   - Keep content as the true focus ("content is king")
   - Avoid overengineered solutions that distract

## Design Direction Evolution
Our design approach has evolved through several key phases:

### Initial Concept: Interactive Illustrations
- Created interactive Ikigai diagram with hover-based interactions
- Implemented animated visualization with 3D effects
- Focus was on creating an engaging, interactive element

### Refinement: Multiple Models with Selection
- Added additional mental models (Eisenhower Matrix, etc.)
- Created a model switching functionality
- Improved animations for more consistent experience

### Reset: Content-First Approach
- Identified issues with overwhelming animations
- Created cleaner layout with better information hierarchy
- Shifted to more explicit, click-based interactions

### Current Challenge: Distinctive Design Experimentation
- Need to balance distinctiveness with usability
- Create a unique visual identity without sacrificing clarity
- Explore creative ways to visualize concepts without overwhelming

## Design Tensions to Navigate

### Animation vs. Understanding
- **Tension**: Engaging animations can enhance understanding but may distract
- **Balance**: Animations should serve pedagogical purpose first
- **Direction**: Use animations to reveal relationships and concepts, not as decoration

### Uniqueness vs. Usability
- **Tension**: Unique designs may be less immediately usable
- **Balance**: Innovation should enhance, not hinder, the learning experience
- **Direction**: Establish new patterns deliberately and consistently

### Artistry vs. Content Focus
- **Tension**: Artistic elements compete with content for attention
- **Balance**: Visual design should amplify content, not overshadow it
- **Direction**: Create a distinctive container that highlights rather than competes

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Interaction Patterns
- Click-based exploration is more accessible than hover
- Consider progressive disclosure to manage complexity
- Use explicit visual affordances

### Animation Approach
- GSAP for complex, sequenced animations
- Framer Motion for UI element transitions
- CSS transitions for simple effects

### Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure keyboard navigability
- Provide alternative paths to information
- Design for screen readers and assistive technologies

## Learning Goals for Users
1. Understand the structure and components of each mental model
2. See how each model applies to real-world situations
3. Develop the ability to apply these models in their own thinking

## Inspiration Sources
- AWWWARD-winning interactive educational sites
- Data visualization projects that balance beauty and clarity
- Interactive essays that guide users through complex concepts

## Next Steps
1. Explore unique visual treatments that amplify content
2. Refine interaction patterns to create more engaging experiences
3. Test with users to ensure understanding matches visual appeal

## Design Principles to Remember
1. Users should leave understanding mental models better
2. Distinctive design should serve the content, not overshadow it
3. Interaction should create insight, not just engagement
4. First impressions matter, but comprehension matters more
