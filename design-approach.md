# Mental Models Website: Design Approach

## Core Purpose
To create an educational resource that helps people understand, remember, and apply mental models in their thinking and decision-making.

## Design Principles

### 1. Content First, Animation Second
- Visualizations should enhance understanding, not overshadow content
- Every animation must serve a pedagogical purpose
- Text and visuals should work together, not compete

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
- Start with simple, clear explanations before revealing complexity
- Allow users to explore deeper levels of understanding at their own pace
- Create natural learning paths through the content

### 3. Thoughtful Interactions
- Interactions should mirror the mental model's own logic
- Create "aha moments" where interaction reinforces understanding
- Use consistent interaction patterns across different models

### 4. Accessibility & Inclusivity
- Design with universal access in mind from the start
- Provide multiple ways to understand concepts (visual, textual, interactive)
- Ensure legibility and readability at all screen sizes

### 5. Elegant Minimalism
- Use restraint with visual effects and animations
- Create breathing room for complex concepts
- Apply consistent design patterns for predictability

## Proposed Layout Structure

### Global
- Clean, distraction-free reading environment
- Consistent navigation and wayfinding
- Subtle, unified color scheme with purposeful accent colors
- Thoughtful typography hierarchy

### Per-Model Structure
1. **Introduction**
   - Brief, clear explanation of the mental model
   - Contextual information (origin, key applications)
   - Simple static visualization for immediate understanding

2. **Core Concept Exploration**
   - Interactive visualization that reveals the model's components
   - Supporting explanations that appear in context
   - Clear relationship between text and visual elements

3. **Practical Application**
   - Real-world examples showing the model in use
   - "Try it yourself" scenarios where possible
   - Further resources and related models

## Visual Design Direction

### Typography
- Limited, purposeful type hierarchy (2-3 sizes max)
- High contrast for readability
- Generous line spacing and paragraph breaks

### Color
- Subdued base palette (light background, dark text or vice versa)
- Strategic use of accent colors to differentiate model components
- Consistent color meaning across visualizations

### Space
- Generous white space to frame content
- Clear separation between sections
- Responsive spacing that maintains relationships at all screen sizes

### Interactions
- Obvious interactive elements
- Feedback that reinforces learning
- Ability to reset or restart interactions
- Smooth, purposeful transitions

## Implementation Approach

1. **Start with content structure**
   - Develop clear information architecture
   - Create content templates for consistency across models

2. **Design core visualization system**
   - Create a unified approach to visualization
   - Develop reusable components and patterns

3. **Apply thoughtful interactions**
   - Start with essential interactions
   - Test and refine for clarity and understanding

4. **Layer in subtle enhancements**
   - Add polish only after core functionality works
   - Ensure animations enhance rather than distract

5. **Test with users**
   - Validate understanding and usability
   - Refine based on how users actually learn from the site
