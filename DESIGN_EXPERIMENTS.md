# Mental Models: Design Experiments

This document outlines experimental design approaches that could set the Mental Models website apart from typical landing pages while maintaining usability and educational value.

## Experimental Approaches

### 1. Spatial Navigation Concept

**Core Idea**: Present mental models as a navigable spatial environment rather than a typical scrolling site.

**Execution**:
- 3D space where each mental model exists as a "region" or "island"
- Camera transitions smoothly between regions as user navigates
- Depth and perspective used to establish information hierarchy
- Subtle particle effects create atmosphere without distraction

**Visual Treatment**:
- Dark, cosmic background with subtle stars/nebula
- Glowing, neon-like elements for primary interactions
- Depth effects using parallax and subtle 3D transformations
- Typography that interacts with the space (revealing/receding)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Three.js for subtle 3D environment
- GSAP for camera movements and transitions
- Canvas-based particle systems for ambient environment

### 2. Dynamic Paper Interface

**Core Idea**: Treat the interface as dynamic paper that folds, unfolds, and reveals content through physical-feeling transformations.

**Execution**:
- Start with a simple paper "card" for each model
- Clicking unfolds/expands to reveal complexity
- Navigation through origami-like transformations
- Information revealed through unfolding

**Visual Treatment**:
- Minimalist, paper-like base with subtle textures
- Light and shadow effects to emphasize physicality
- Crisp typography with excellent contrast
- Strategic use of color to emphasize model components

**Technical Implementation**:
- SVG-based animations for precise folding effects
- Physics-based calculations for natural movement
- Strategic use of 3D CSS transforms

### 3. Abstract Minimalism

**Core Idea**: Ultra-minimalist interface where content emerges through abstract, geometric representations.

**Execution**:
- Begin with abstract geometric representations of each model
- Interaction morphs abstraction into clearer representation
- Transition from abstract → conceptual → concrete examples
- Gestural interactions that transform the visualization

**Visual Treatment**:
- High contrast, limited color palette
- Geometric primitives that transform meaningfully
- Typography as a design element
- Generous negative space

**Technical Implementation**:
- SVG animations for geometric transformations
- Canvas for more complex visualizations
- Subtle cursor-following effects

### 4. Embodied Interaction

**Core Idea**: Make users physically engage with mental models through gesture, mouse movement, or scroll in ways that embody the concept.

**Execution**:
- For Eisenhower Matrix: Physically sort cards with mouse/touch
- For Second-Order Thinking: Unfold cascading consequences
- For Inversion: Physically flip/invert elements
- For Circle of Competence: Draw/define boundaries

**Visual Treatment**:
- Clear, instructional elements
- Visual feedback that confirms interaction
- Progressive complexity revealed through interaction
- Playful but purposeful animations

**Technical Implementation**:
- Drag and drop interactions
- Physics-based animations
- Cursor position tracking
- Web animations API for seamless transitions

### 5. Cognitive Typography

**Core Idea**: Use typography itself as the primary visual element, with text that responds, reshapes, and embodies concepts.

**Execution**:
- Typography that responds to interaction
- Words that reshape to demonstrate concepts
- Text as the visualization itself
- Meaning revealed through typographic transformation

**Visual Treatment**:
- Large, expressive typography
- Limited color palette, focused on contrast
- Subtle background gradients
- Minimal UI elements beyond the text itself

**Technical Implementation**:
- SVG text manipulations
- Text morphing with GSAP
- Split text characters for granular animation
- Scroll-based text transformations

## Implementation Strategy

For each experiment:

1. **Create a Prototype**
   - Implement core interaction for one mental model
   - Test basic usability and clarity
   - Gather initial feedback

2. **Evaluate Against Goals**
   - Visual distinctiveness
   - Educational effectiveness
   - Technical feasibility
   - User engagement

3. **Iterate or Pivot**
   - Refine promising directions
   - Abandon approaches that sacrifice clarity
   - Combine successful elements from different approaches

## Measuring Success

A successful design experiment will:

1. Create a memorable, distinctive visual experience
2. Maintain or enhance educational clarity
3. Enable intuitive interaction without extensive explanation
4. Appropriately balance form and function
5. Create a sense of discovery and delight
