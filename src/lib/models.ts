While first-order thinking asks "What will happen next?", second-order thinking asks "And then what?" multiple times.

Within your circle are subjects you understand well enough to make reliable judgments and predictions.

    longDescription: 'Inversion is a powerful mental model that involves approaching problems backward. Instead of focusing directly on how to achieve a goal, you consider what would cause the opposite result and work to avoid those pitfalls. This technique, championed by mathematician Carl Jacobi who advised "Invert, always invert," and popularized by Charlie Munger, helps identify hidden obstacles, potential failure points, and cognitive blindspots. By thinking backward from the outcome you want to avoid, you often gain more actionable insights than by only thinking forward from your current position toward your goal. Inversion complements forward thinking rather than replacing it.',
